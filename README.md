# balatro-save-sync

a script for syncronizing save-data and mods between desktop balatro and a balatro-mobile-maker built apk.

### Note 
[related issue](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/issues/137)

If any mods you're installing have module patches (search for [patches.module] in the mods' patch files), place the specified file in the game folder and rename it to match to module's name. Some mods like Talisman may ship with their own copy of nativefs, you don't need duplicates of this.
